    - The core objective was to successfully navigate the car through a course track autonomously at a comparable speed.
    - Apart from the core objective, the vehicle was also required to perform the following challenges: backing out of a collision and performing a power slide during turns.
    - The navigation block of the vehicle was implemented using a state machine - which had inputs primarily from an RGBD Camera and sent appropriate commands to an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller). The ESC controls both the drive and steering motors.
    - The project allowed us to look at the real-world challenges of autonomous vehicles more closely, and provided us with a practical experience working with ROS.

    - Using basic image processing techniques like bilateral filtering, laplace transform and morphological operations have achieved an average dice coefficient of 0.862 on a subset of images from carvana dataset. 
    - The time taken to process an image was 28s on average.

    - Implemented the following research paper `DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs`.
    - Used transfer learning i.e used a pre-trained VGG16 model, trained for the task of object detection with some modifications and re-tuned it for the task of semantic segmentation.
    - The model uses atrous convolutions instead of normal convolutions to tackle the issue of reduced spatial resolution due to repeated max pooling.
    - Augmented PASCAL VOC dataset of 8498 images was used to train the model.
    - The mean IOU achieved was 0.52 on validation set and 0.573 on test set.

    - Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent.
    - This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

    - Continued my work at the internship, mainly worked on increasing the skin classification accuracy of first stage.
    - Completed the project with a model using 19 features on a random forest comprising of 200 trees, with an accuracy of 80%.
