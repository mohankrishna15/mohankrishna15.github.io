    - Implemented the following research paper `DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs`.
    - Used transfer learning i.e used a pre-trained VGG16 model, trained for the task of object detection with some modifications and re-tuned it for the task of semantic segmentation.
    - The model uses atrous convolutions instead of normal convolutions to tackle the issue of reduced spatial resolution due to repeated max pooling.
    - Augmented PASCAL VOC dataset of 8498 images was used to train the model.
    - The mean IOU achieved was 0.52 on validation set and 0.573 on test set.

    - Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent.
    - This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

    - Continued my work at the internship, mainly worked on increasing the skin classification accuracy of first stage.
    - Completed the project with a model using 19 features on a random forest comprising of 200 trees, with an accuracy of 80%.
